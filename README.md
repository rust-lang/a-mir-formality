# a-mir-formality

This repository is an early-stage experimental project that aims to be a complete, authoritative formal model of the [Rust MIR](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html).
Presuming these experiments bear fruit, the intention is to bring this model into Rust as an RFC
and develop it as an official part of the language definition.

## Quickstart guide

Like any Rust project:

* Clone
* `cargo test --all`
